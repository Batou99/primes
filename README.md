# Exercise

Please write a simple Ruby program which takes a single number n from the user and in response displays n*n table, such that the content of cell (a,b) is a sum of a-th and b-th prime number. So for example for input `3` the output should read:

```
4 5  7
5 6  8
7 8 10
```

You can use any library available except for prime number generation. The solution should be hosted as public repository on github. Please remember about the tests, and best industry practices. The code should represent good design structure and maintainability.

# Run

Just run `./scripts/run` or `ruby main.rb`

# Test

Just run `./scripts/test` or run any test file like `ruby test/primelib_test.rb`
